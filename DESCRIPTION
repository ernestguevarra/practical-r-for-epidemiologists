Title: Practical R for Epidemiologists
Description: This guide is intended as a practical introduction to using the R 
    environment for data analysis and graphics to work with epidemiological data. 
    Topics covered include univariate statistics, simple statistical inference, 
    charting data, two-by-two tables, stratified analysis, chi-square test for 
    trend, logistic regression, survival analysis, computer-intensive methods, 
    and extending R using user-provided functions. You should be able to follow 
    the material if you are reasonably familiar with the mechanics of statistical 
    estimation (e.g. calculation of odds ratios and confidence intervals) and 
    require a system that can perform simple or complex analyses to your exact 
    specifications. If you are interested in a system that is flexible, can be 
    tailored to produce exactly the analysis you want, provides modern analytical 
    facilities, and have a basic understanding of the mechanics of hypothesis 
    testing and estimation then you should consider purchasing this book.
